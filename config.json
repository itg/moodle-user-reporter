  "disclaimer": "<p>This automated message contains a link to download a collection of 'Activity Report' and 'Gradebook' files for each student listed below. The 'Activity Report' shows when a student was most recently active in Moodle. The 'Gradebook' shows graded assignments. Both of these reports are automatically generated by Moodle.</p><p>It's important to remember that MMCC instructors are not required to utilize Moodle for course content or grading, and therefore information may be incomplete or missing from these reports. The gradebook, in particular, varies between courses, and will sometimes not calculate correctly until an instructor has entered all grades and/or zeros for missing student assignments.</p><p>These reports reflect students who are actively dual enrolled. Please keep these reports strictly confidential and be mindful of where these documents are stored.</p>"
